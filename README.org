#+TITLE: Nix flake for Zig

** Description
   In this repository lives a Nix flake packaging the *Zig* compiler binaries using the [[https://ziglang.org/download/index.json][data]] provided by the Zig team.

*** Provided utilities
  - /Nightly/ versions updated daily (=.master.<date>=), starting from version =0.8.0-dev.1140+9270aae07= dated 2021-02-13, and latest master (=.master.latest=) for the sake of convenience.
  - Release versions.

*** Usage
**** Without flake support?
     Import in your project as you would normally (=pkgs.fetchFromGitHub= or =builtins.fetchgit=), with (/hopefully/) no tinkering needed! The =default.nix= exposes a =pkgs= argument for possible pinning of the Nixpkgs repository, and a =system= argument which defaults to =builtins.currentSystem=.

     To make it visible in your system configuration:
     #+begin_src nix
       # It is a good idea to use an exact commit in place of 'main' here.
       let zigf = fetchTarball "https://github.com/arqv/zig-overlay/archive/main.tar.gz" in
         # If you're using home-manager
         home.packages = [ zigf.master.latest ]; # or any available version
         # If you're using NixOS
         users.user.<username>.packages = [ zigf.master.latest ]; # or any available version
       # ...the rest of your configuration
     #+end_src

**** With flake support?
     In your =flake.nix= file:
    #+begin_src nix
      {
        inputs.zig.url = "github:arqv/zig-overlay";
        outputs = { self, zig, ... }: {
          ...
        };
      }
    #+end_src
     In a shell:
    #+begin_src sh
      # run the latest version (0.7.1)
      $ nix run 'github:arqv/zig-overlay'
      # open a shell with master version dated 2021-02-13 (oldest version available)
      $ nix shell 'github:arqv/zig-overlay#master."2021-02-13"'
      # open a shell with latest master version
      $ nix shell 'github:arqv/zig-overlay#master.latest'
    #+end_src
 
** For contributors
  The =update= script manages updating the information in =sources.json=. The only dependency is Nix, and it's written internally in Ruby.
